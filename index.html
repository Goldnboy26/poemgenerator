      <p>Here I go, telling everyone that I desire you and need to be closer to you. You are a wonderful person who has allowed me to realize the important things in life. I appreciate and thank you dearly. I am here and always will be. All you have to do is e-mail me, and you know I'll answer you. This is your invitation, and it'll be open whenever you're ready to do the rest. You've showed me true love, something no one has ever done before. Thanks.</p>

      <p>After being your best friend and telling you all my hopes and desires, I need to tell you what will make me happy.

        You have always been there for me through our ups and downs; you've listened to my problems and, most of all, you've put up with me and all the crazy things I do. I love being with you and acting like fools, and I just love everything about you.
        
        You are the best friend I have ever had, but last night when I was trying to go to sleep, I kept thinking about all the other boys. But then I thought about you, and I couldn't stop thinking about you! I thought about all the good times we've had together, and I thought about that day we went mudding on the four wheelers, and I realized that it's not the other people I want to be with, it's you. I love you and I want to be with you, forever and a day.</p>

      <p>As I sit here and think about you and what you and I have been through, I see that I can only love you more and more with each passing day. You're my inspiration each and every day. You are what keeps me going when I just want to give up. You are my reason for living. I love the way that you love me. I love every kiss and every touch. I wouldn't know where to turn if I didn't have you. You are this girl's dream come true.

        I wish you could feel all the passion and all the love that I carry around for you. You have won my heart and soul. You have won it all. You make me feel like I am in heaven--in the arms of an angel. You and I have a fulfilling relationship, but as it goes on, I wonder which is it--friends or lovers? That is not certain yet. We've been friends for a while now, but the friendship isn't just that anymore, at least for me. I have fallen in love with you, and I need to tell you that I am your soul mate masquerading as a good friend.</p>
